2002-03-15 Scott Bucholtz <linuxman@linuxmanland.com>
	* Added Tobias Diedrich's <ranma@gmx.at> new subtitles patch
	  which is much easier than the old ones because of the utilization
	  of libdvdread.


2002-03-06 Gerald Henrikse <ghenriks@rogers.com>
	* Changed things so that the compiler now determines whether to use
	  module versioning instead of having the makefile apply it by default.
	* Added sysinclude/dxr2modver.h to cover this and only included into 
	  the source files that required it to make an insertable module.
	  
	 
2002-03-05 Scott Bucholtz <linuxman@linuxmanland.com>
	* Applied Leonid Froenchenko's <lfroen@galileo.co.il> patch which
	  fixes a race condition in the overlay procedure.


2002-03-01 Scott Bucholtz <linuxman@linuxmanland.com>
	* Made minor modification to dvd C wrapper so that you can (optionally)
	  give it the title number that is desired to be played as an argument.
	* Fixed compilation warning message about __DVD_DEBUG being re-defined
	  so that now (at least on my system) the entire driver compiles and
	  installs without warning messages.
	* Removed file in source_patchs/ directory to speed up download time
	  (and remove useless files).
	* Cleaned up this file so it looks perty.  :)

		
2002-02-18 Scott Bucholtz <linuxman@linuxmanland.com>
	* Applied James Hawtin's <oolon@ankh.org> IFO parser patch.  This
	  requires a patched version of libdvdread available at
	  http://dxr2.sourceforge.net/
	* Patched dvd wrapper so that it utilizes the new IFO parser.
	* I hope I didn't break anything.  The patch was made against an older
	  CVS so I tryed to put everything in sync (please don't break...).

	  
2002-02-05 Scott Bucholtz <linuxman@linuxmanland.com>
	* Changed makefile so that modules are installed with permissions 644
	  instead of 755 (for kernel compliance).
	* Added dvd, undvd, and dvd-sum to the players directory (and thus
	  modified both the players/makefile and makefile to build/install
	  them).  These seem to be fairly stable wrappers (and they dynamically
	  figure stuff out (like mountpoints, etc.)).

	  
2002-01-08 Raphael Zulliger <zulli@gmx.net>
           * Changed makefile. commands like modprobe and depmod changed into
	     /sbin/modprobe, /sbin/depmod

	     
2001-12-19 Josh Steele <jsteele@codefusion.org>
[1.0.3]	   * applied the newer patch submitted by Scott Bucholtz
	     *HACK's are BAD patch ;)* fixing the module license 
	     problem, the newer patch fixes problem with both new 
	     and old kernels
	   * Got rid of all linux/malloc.h includes in source, and 
	     replaced them with linux/slab.h


2001-12-18 Raphael Zulliger <zulli@gmx.net>
            * Added some #ifdef to the changes from Bucholtz. so it should 
	      work on old and newer kernels...


2001-12-18 Josh Steele <jsteele@codefusion.org>
	    * updated documentation
	    * added module license patch submitted by Scott Bucholtz 
	      <linuxman@linuxmanland.com>


2001-09-03 Raphael Zulliger <zulli@gmx.net>
	    * readded SMP support (has to be tested by someone)
	    * 'make install' now installes the dxr2-headers into
	      /usr/src/linux/include/linux/dxr2 (is that ok?)
	    * installing the modules should work now - even if the
	      /lib/modules/2.x.x-xxx/kernel/drivers/video - directory doesn't
	      exist
	    * it compiles dvdplay*-programms again and installes them into
	      /usr/local/bin


2001-xx-xx Raphael Zulliger <zulli@gmx.net>
	    * changed the (almost) whole makefile to fix problems with newer
	      kernel's (2.4.x)


1999-11-09  Andrew de Quincey <adq@tardis.ed.ac.uk>
	    * Added new player source tree, and last update to test by Evan
	      Van Dyke


1999-11-08  Andrew de Quincey <adq@tardis.ed.ac.uk>
	    * Fixed type determination code again :) (added type ZIVADS_TYPE_2)
 	    * Fixed tc6807af CSS code (couple of minor bugs found)
	    * Fixed player CSS code: sets DXR2_CSSDECRMODE_ON after CSS auth,
	      and also works out the "mysterious" extra title key byte for
	      tc6807af (turned out it contained the CGMS flags).
	    * Added bitstream type selection options to player. (VCDs now
	      playable)
	    * Couple of miscellaneous fixes to player.


1999-11-07  Andrew de Quincey <adq@tardis.ed.ac.uk>
	    * Added new player by Evan Van Dyke
	    * Fixed zivaDS type determination code.


1999-11-06  Andrew de Quincey <adq@tardis.ed.ac.uk>
	    * Added Evan Van Dyke's combo-patch to the code for 
	      multithreaded player, and a few other things
	    * Added Mordechai T. Abzug's makefiles patches.
	    * Added <mtaht@picketwyre.com>'s makefile patches for module 
	      versions


1999-11-04  Andrew de Quincey <adq@tardis.ed.ac.uk>
	    * Fixed up the card's CSS stuff so that it now works properly,
	      and added CSS authentication to the player. The player now
	      REQUIRES the DVD CSS ioctls patch from http://www.kernel.dk/
	      to compile


1999-11-01  Andrew de Quincey <adq@tardis.ed.ac.uk>
(v0.9.2b)   Lucien Murray-Pitts <lucien@martincurrie.com>
	    * Testing revealed race problem with IRQ handler on slower
	      machines... rewrote it to avoid this.


1999-10-31  Andrew de Quincey <adq@tardis.ed.ac.uk>
(v0.9.1b)   * Fixed video transmission/IRQ handling code.


1999-10-20  Andrew de Quincey <adq@tardis.ed.ac.uk>
(v0.9b)	    Lucien Murray-Pitts <lucien@martincurrie.com>
